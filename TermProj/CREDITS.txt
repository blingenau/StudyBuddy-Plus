Contributed ideas that led to the basis of our project's purpose.
Worked on the connectivity of the database where php post requests were used to input
new users that registers and logging in. Coded the search query
to find relevant groups in our database that pertains to group name, course number, and description
and the password change form so users if they want to, can change their password.
